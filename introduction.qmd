# Introduction

## 1.1 Analyzing U.S Natural Gas Trends

Natural gas is a fossil fuel composed primarily of methane (CH₄), with small amounts of ethane, propane, carbon dioxide and other gases. As a clean and efficient energy source, natural gas occupies an important place in the global energy mix and is widely used in power generation, heating, industry and transportation.

Natural gas is seen as a low-carbon alternative to coal and oil because of the low greenhouse gas emissions from its combustion. Demand for natural gas will continue to grow in the near term as countries push for an energy transition to combat climate change.

This analysis will reveal the time series of natural gas supply, demand and pricing, to provide insights into the global impact of natural gas, and to make forecasts for future natural gas developments.

## 1.2 Big Picture

This study examines the global natural gas market from multiple analytical perspectives, providing a comprehensive understanding of its historical trends, current dynamics, and future outlook. Natural gas plays a crucial role in energy security, economic growth, and climate policies, making it essential to analyze various factors that shape its trajectory. Key areas of focus include price trends and volatility, which involve understanding historical fluctuations, identifying drivers of price instability, and assessing regional pricing differences. Additionally, supply and demand correlations are explored to investigate the relationship between global production levels, consumption patterns, and international trade, assessing how imbalances impact markets. The study also analyzes the influence of major geopolitical events, such as conflicts, trade restrictions, and energy policies, on global natural gas supply and pricing. Finally, forecasting future trends through time series models and predictive analytics helps anticipate future market trends, demand growth, and potential supply chain disruptions. ![Figure 1.1: The 4 overarching perspectives of projects](picture/bigpicture.jpg)

## 1.3 Literature Review

1.  Biden Administration Releases LNG Export Study, Urging Caution on New Permits (Reuters, 2024) This government-backed study examines the economic and environmental implications of LNG exports from the United States. The research underscores the geopolitical significance of LNG exports in the context of global energy security, trade relations, and domestic economic policies. The study suggests that future export permits should be evaluated with caution, given the potential impact on domestic gas prices and international energy diplomacy.
